#CI/CD Ninja pipeline approach 
    The only scripts you will need in ninja are your get-github script and your stub scripts. The actual scripts should be pulled down per each run and only grab the latest revision each time. 

1. run the Github script
2. set up your stub script & run your stub script w/ any parameters you may need
